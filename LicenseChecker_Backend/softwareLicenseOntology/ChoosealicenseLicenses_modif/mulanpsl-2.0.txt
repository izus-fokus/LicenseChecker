title: Mulan Permissive Software License, Version 2
spdx-id: MulanPSL-2.0
nickname: Mulan PSL v2

description: A permissive license similar to the <a href="/licenses/apache-2.0/">Apache License</a>, but explicitly states that it does not grant trademark rights. Mulan Permissive Software License is the first open source license in both Chinese and English approved by OSI.

how: Create a text file (typically named LICENSE or LICENSE.txt) in the root of your source code and copy the text of the license into the file.

note: It's suggested to take the additional step of adding a boilerplate notice to the top of each file. The boilerplate can be found at the end of the license.
